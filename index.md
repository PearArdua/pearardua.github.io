## About Me
My name is Emma. I'm passionate about technology, programming and problem solving. I am working towards a degree in computer science and have been working in the IT industry for the past two years.

I'm also an avid gamer and enjoy playing all kinds of games, from board games to computer games. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends, travelling and reading.

I made this site for my CTI-110 class at FTCC.

I'm excited to be exploring web development and to start a new journey in this field. I'm eager to learn and grow, and I'm confident that I can create great things.
